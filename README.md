# chromatic-aberration-shader
Simple 2D chromatic aberration shader written in GLSL, designed for Game Maker Studio 2

INCLUDES:
**CREATE EVENT, DRAW EVENT, STEP EVENT, shd_chrabb.fsh, README.md**

USES:
Creates chromatic aberration effect on 2D graphics, with the ability to enable or disable using the spacebar

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Create a new shader called shd_chrabb
2. Copy the contents of shd.chrabb.fsh and paste over the contents of the shader's fragment shader code. The vertex shader should be fine by default, so don't worry about changing anything there.
3. You can copy the contents of **CREATE EVENT**, **DRAW EVENT**, and **STEP EVENT** directly into the object where you want to use the shader. The shader should be enabled by default, and you can press spacebar to disable or re-enable it while the program is running.
